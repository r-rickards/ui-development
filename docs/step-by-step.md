# → Steps

## ⦿ Step 1. Node.js installation

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable web applications. To install it, please:

1. Go to nodejs.org and download node.js

2. Launch the installer and install Node with all default settings (that means - click `next` until it gets installed).

## ⦿ Step 2. Git installation

This is necessary both for proper project development and **MDB CLI** to be able to clone starter projects.

Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers. To install it, please:

1. Go to gitforwindows.org and download Git.

2. Launch the installer and install Git with all default settings (similar to above - click `next` until it gets installed).

## ⦿ Step 3. Installing MDB CLI globally

1. Open PowerShell:

```bash
> npm install -g mdb-cli
```

The `npm install` command we've used here is a command that uses the **Node Package Manager (npm)** to install **MDB CLI** onto your computer.

The `-g` flag in this command tells npm to install **MDB CLI** globally onto your computer, which allows you to use the mdb command anywhere on your system.

Searching for a company, extension or technology + `logo png transparent` and clicking on the **Images** tab

find an image and control click and select `Copy Image Address` in the context menu.

Use that in as the `src` of an **&lt;img /&gt;**

Use the style and width attributes to get it how you like.

## Proactive DNA

Add value to the organization; Don't make everyone do the same research that you just did. If together we learn to have something researched once and that knowledge shared then we each have more time and less frustration. Information kept in your head can't be leveraged.

**Leverage by sharing**

> Spend more time writing good documentation, less time answering questions.
