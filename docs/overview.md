This documentation is for Software, a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) containing the backend and frontend projects.

Documentation is a part of building a world-class product.

> All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.

The consistency gained makes the code more readable and hence maintainable.

This level of consistency is where boilerplate and opportunities to [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) things up or generate surface.

> Researching and testing best practices and _baking them into the framework_ - reduces decision making at code time, enhances flowand by extrapolation, productivity.
